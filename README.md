<h3>About me ðŸ‘‹</h3>
My name is Samuel, and I have been on a journey to become a skilled Quality Assurance (QA) professional since mid-2019. Iâ€™m thrilled to have found a field where I can truly thrive and grow. Throughout my learning experience, Iâ€™ve developed a strong passion for Software QA, with a particular focus on accessibility. I firmly believe that as a QA specialist, I have the power to make the digital world more inclusive and accessible for everyone.
This portfolio reflects both my expertise and the practical skills I've acquired through formal courses, self-study, and hands-on experience in my job. I am committed to expanding my knowledge and capabilities in this domain, especially as I dive deeper into test automation. My current priority is to enhance my understanding and skills in this area, and I am excited to continue evolving as a QA professional.
