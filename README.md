<h3>My Experience üë©‚Äçüíª‚ú®</h3>
As a QA Executive since 2019, I have been dedicated to ensuring software quality and functionality through manual and automated testing. I analyze requirements to create detailed test plans and test cases, performing various types of testing such as functional, regression, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the software‚Äôs performance. Additionally, I conduct performance testing and security testing to ensure the application can handle high loads and is free from vulnerabilities. I also ensure accessibility testing, making sure products are inclusive for all users. I collaborate with developers to identify, report, and resolve bugs using tools like Jira, and I contribute to continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes, automating tests with tools like Katalon/Selenium and JUnit. I document test results, track issues, and provide feedback to ensure the software meets both functional and non-functional requirements. My contributions have led to improved bug detection, faster release cycles, and a better overall user experience. Passionate about ongoing learning, I strive to maintain high software quality and implement best practices in every project .
